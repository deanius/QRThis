Messages  - (formerly Slogans) What is it *you* have to say ? If you can say it in 140 characters or less, we can encode it with or without formatting (really up to about ) If it's better seen than explained, put the link (URL) to the youtube video that shows it - people who scan who have the internet available will immediately start seeing the video.

Bottles - ('contain' Qrcodes) How would you like your message framed ? Would you like it to appear in conjunction with your blog, online profile, or resume ? Would you like to see who has visited your message, or allow them to leave notes for you ? We can bottle your message that way too. We have several pre-built bottle types, or ask us if you have an idea for your own.
