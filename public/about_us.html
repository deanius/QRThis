<h2>About Us</h2>
<p>
How did you find us if you don't know what we are or do?

Well, whatever. We might be a snarky and pretentious click of cool web geeks, but we won't make any money if we don't allow any new people into the club. So like, yeah, welcome to yet another tech trend, QR'ing. 

Basically, a QR code is a box with a lot of dots in it. That code can hold a message or a link to any website on the planet. The QR code can be read by a smartphone app.

Wanna wear a T-shirt that says "Fuck [insert highschool name here]" and not get in trouble? Put it in a QR code on your shirt, and let your friends scan it with their smartphones.

Wanna create a viral marketing campaign for your company to a hip, techy audience? Put it in a QR code.

It's never been easier or more affordable to put QR codes on anything.

Click here to get a QR reading app right now or click here or to start building your own QR code T-shirt, sticker, etc.

<h2>But seriously, who the hell are we</h2>
<p>We are a bunch of slackers who are sick of working for the man. We're subversive to the max and cynical enough to go out of our way to piggyback and promote a new trend that let's us take the money of our friends and fellow tech geeks. In return, you've got a ticket to ride the wave of our coolness. Aren't you lucky.</p>
